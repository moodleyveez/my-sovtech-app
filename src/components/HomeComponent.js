        <p><i>Being a 26 year old graduate with little to no experience has been challenging to say the least, I have been trying to maintain my skills and capablilities within my own personcal capacity  and have fallen short in many instances. 
            I believe that SovTech will be able to provide me with the much needed guidance and mentorship that will help me achieve my goal of becoming an expert in the field of Software and Web Development. I have been faced with challenges without being given the necessary tools, or rather, the manner in which the tools can be used to utilitize an outcome. 
            I believe that SovTech has the program to help me be more capable and help me grow in my career and personal components. SovTech has provided the perception of growth and innovation, I believe that SovTech has a team that is unified with sculpting young minds. I want to be a part of a team that will help the next generation and generations to come. 
            SovTech is an opportunity that I have been eagerly waiting for, to be granted this opportunity will mean the start of something new and great for myself, for SovTech and for Development as a whole.</i></p>
